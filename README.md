This is an initial version of the CRF release.

To download supporting files:

To build this version of caffe:

  follow instructions for setting up dependencies: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
  
  cd caffe;
  mkdir build;
  cd build;
  cmake ..;
  make -j8;
  cd ../..;

To get dev results:

Note: I've merged this caffe fork with the version of caffe as of 9/18/16. It has weak cudnn v5 support (~1.8 speed up), and I will merge again when full support is added.

Notes:
 Use Ubuntu 14
 Use Anaconda with python 2.7
 Remove uuid and tiff libraries from Anaconda while building
 Contact pkubal@buffalo.edu for AWS AMI for the Successful Caffe Build
